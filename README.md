# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project is a Python-based hand gesture recognition application using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The goal of this project is to detect and recognize various hand gestures in real-time using a webcam or camera feed.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and landmark tracking.
- Recognition of common hand gestures such as thumbs up, high five, rock 'n' roll, and more.
- Integration with OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries for efficient computer vision processing.
- User-friendly interface with visual feedback for detected gestures.
